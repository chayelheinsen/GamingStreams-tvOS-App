# GamingStreams-tvOS-App

This is a cool app I built to learn more on tvOS. The goal is to offer an aggregation of streams from different networks like:

- twitch.tv
- youtube gaming
- hitbox.tv

I only support **Twitch** at the moment, features are :

- Browse by game and streamer
- Live chat with emoticons
- Change video quality

# Running the Project

###Things you need:
* A version of XCode that supports tvOS
* A version of Cocoapods that supports tvos (i.e. `sudo gem install cocoapods -pre` )

### Installing Dependencies	
Since we're not including the /Pods directory in the git, you must run `pod install` inside the project directory to install dependencies

Make sure you open GamingStreamsTVApp.xcworkspace to include the generated Pods or you will run into compile errors.

This is more of a MVP. I am looking for contributors to achieve various tasks:

- some of the code was written before I knew about Swift standards.
- design changes ?
- some of the structure can be abstracted
- better exception handling
- new cool features like a search bar, twitch login etc.
- tests

I would like to see this app on the market on Apple TV launch day.**If this project interests you, please contact me :)**
